# About this project

AVRliberty is a library of easy-to-use C functions for a variety of common and uncommon tasks using AVR processors. It is the open source project heavily based on original Procyon AVRlib (http://www.mil.ufl.edu/~chrisarnold/components/microcontrollerBoard/AVR/avrlib/).

# Why was this project created?

The goal of original Procyon AVRlib was to allow programmers to work quickly towards their end goal by reducing the time needed to write basic support functions and code.

Unfortunately (as of 3/28/2012) last known official release of AVRlib was dated September 20, 2005 - more than 7 years ago.

Atmel and other vendors continue release new hardware every day. Also there's some places in original avrlib waiting to be improved or rewritten. So with all the respect to Pascal Stang, author of original library, I decided to start AVRliberty to let present day developers to cooperate while maintaining and expanding AVRlib.
